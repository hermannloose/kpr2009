h1. Notes

This release still includes some packages built for testing purposes.

The packages comprising my solution for our assignments are the following
 in @l4/pkg@:

* @console@
* @fb_muxer@
* @kbd@
* @kbdhelper@
* @libc_backends@
* @log2console@
* @paddle@

The assignment setup is started selecting "Mein Pong" in GRUB.

This will use the @kpr*.cfg@ files in @tftpboot/conf@, the other files refer
 to said testing setups.

h1. Keys used

* @F1@ and @F2@ for switching between consoles.
* @a@ and @d@ or @w@ and @s@ for the respective paddles in pong.
* @PageUp@, @PageDown@, @Up@, @Down@, @Pos1@ and @End@ for scrolling in the
 console window.
